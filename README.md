# AppliedDataScienceCapstone_SpaceX
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against Space X for a rocket launch. 

In this project, I will have the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. I will explain step by step this project, and at the end, I will predict the project with several models and draw a comparison chart.
